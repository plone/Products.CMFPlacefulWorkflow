1.4.3 (unreleased)
==================

- Define wtool inside the prefs_workflow_policy_mapping template.
  [hannosch]

- Removed settings of the portal_skins tool itself from skins.xml.
  Specifically, allow_any was set to False, which bit me.  [maurits]

- Made worflow policies translatable in prefs_workflow_localpolicies_form.

1.4.2 (2009-03-05)
==================

- The `Cancel` button on the local workflow configuration screen was saving
  data as much as the `Save` button. Now it actually cancels the operation.
  [hannosch]

- Made sure you cannot set a workflow configuration on a non-folderish item
  in the site root. The actual configuration would end up on the site root.
  [hannosch]

- Change the local workflow configuration screen to not be shown for the
  site root, even if you accidentally type in the wrong URL.

  of Globals.
