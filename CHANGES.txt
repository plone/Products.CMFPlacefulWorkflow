Changelog
=========

1.5.8 (unreleased)
------------------

- Fixed updating Role Mappings only in current folder.
  [kroman0]

- Added 'CMFPlacefulWorkflow: Manage workflow policies' permission. ManageWorkflowPolicies is
  no longer 'Manage portal', it's now assigned to 'CMFPlacefulWorkflow: Manage workflow policies'.
  [alecghica]

- Fixed add workflow policy template (via ZMI).
  [alecghica]

- Fixed descriptions under placeful_workflow_configuration.pt for sections
  "For this folder" and "Below this folder".
  [alecghica]

- Added "update security" as an option field on local configuration management
  form, as in most cases updating catalog role mappings can be a very long operation
  and is better to be made as a separate upgrade step.

  [vincentfretin]

1.5b1 - 2009-12-27
------------------

- Avoid showing the content type icons in the workflow mapping screens.
  [hannosch]

- Small code cleanup and removal of unused imports.
  [hannosch]

1.5a2 - 2009-11-18
------------------

- Make CMFPlacefulWorkflow tool an ImmutableId object, but not a UniqueObject.
  The UniqueObject base class specifies that it is impossible to have any
  other object with the same id (portal_placeful_workflow). This was breaking
  in-ZODB GenericSetup snapshots, because the GenericSetup sub-folder for
  placeful workflow policies happens to also be called
  portal_placeful_workflow. Plone has a checkId script which disallows
  shadowing tools anyway, so the UniqueObject base class is a nicety rather
  than a necessity.
  [optilude]

1.5a1 - 2009-11-18
------------------

- Removed createSnapshot() call from exportimport.txt test. It wasn't doing
  anything useful, and caused a distracting test failure not related to
  CMFPlacefulWorkflow.

- Fix #9359: CMFPlacefulWorkflow defines __implements__ with zope3 interface.
  [encolpe]

- Remove use of the deprecated document_byline macro in the placeful
  workflow configuration template.
  [davisagli]

- Register configlet icon using icon_expr for forwards-compatibility
  with Plone 4.
  [davisagli]

- Copied safeEditProperty function from CMFPlone's migrations package,
  as that is being removed.
  [davisagli]

- Change imports from Globals to use canonical locations, for compatibility
  with Zope 2.12.
  [davisagli]

- Define wtool inside the prefs_workflow_policy_mapping template.
  [hannosch]

- Removed settings of the portal_skins tool itself from skins.xml.
  Specifically, allow_any was set to False, which bit me.
  [maurits]

- Made worflow policies translatable in prefs_workflow_localpolicies_form.
  [vincentfretin]

1.4.2 - 2009-03-05
------------------

- The `Cancel` button on the local workflow configuration screen was saving
  data as much as the `Save` button. Now it actually cancels the operation.
  [hannosch]

- Made sure you cannot set a workflow configuration on a non-folderish item
  in the site root. The actual configuration would end up on the site root.
  [hannosch]

- Change the local workflow configuration screen to not be shown for the
  site root, even if you accidentally type in the wrong URL.
  [hannosch]

1.4.1 (2009-01-17)
------------------

- Declare package dependencies and fixed deprecation warnings for use
  of Globals.
  [hannosch]

- Copied safeEditProperty from CMFPlone.migration_util to avoid a dependency.
  [hannosch]


1.4.0 (2008-11-05)
------------------

- Port evolutions from the 1.3 maintenance branch (old style product).
  [encolpe]

- Fixed bad version in metadata.xml (again)
  [encolpe]

- Removed Favorite content type.

  prefs_workflow_policy_mapping.  Fix prepared by jhackel.  Fixes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8101
